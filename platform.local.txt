# Custom configuration options for BGA's Custom Blinklib.

# Note that you can have only one "compiler.cpp.extra_flags" line so if you want
# to enable/disable multiple features in the future (currently it does not make
# sense with the options available), just add all defines to a single line. For
# example: "compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DXXX -DYYY -DZZZ".

# Uncomment the line below to fully disable datagram support (saving over 100
# bytes of storage).
#compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DBGA_CUSTOM_BLINKLIB_DISABLE_DATAGRAM

# Uncomment the line below to enable data checksum on IR transmissions. This is
# on top of what BlinkBIOS already does and does not look like it is really
# useful. It is here fore for experimenting than anything else. Takes around
# 200 bytes of storage when enabled.
#compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DBGA_CUSTOM_BLINKLIB_ENABLE_CHECKSUM
